# for-and-foreach-loops
Exercise 14 for the "More C# Programming and Unity" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

Problem 1 - Create objects

Follow the instructions from the Lecture Resources for the Adding a DLL lecture from last week to add the ConsoleCards.dll from the zip file as a reference for your project.

Inside the Main method, declare a deck variable and create a new Deck object for that variable.

Inside the Main method, declare a list variable that will hold a hand of cards and create a new list object for that variable.

Tell the deck to shuffle itself.

Problem 2 - Deal and print the cards in a hand using for and foreach loops

Use a for loop to deal 5 cards from the deck to the hand

Use a foreach loop to flip all the cards in the hand over. Do NOT hard-code 5 as the upper limit of the loop.

Use a foreach loop (not a for loop) to print all the cards in the hand (remember, the Card class exposes a Print method).
